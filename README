This is an OpenType math font font based on He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
math fonts.

The font is highly experimental, there is no guarantee it will work for
you, bug reports are welcomed.

The font is used mainly as a playground to explore the possibilities
of Arabic right-to-left math typesetting and OpenType math fonts. As
the time of writing this, only LuaTeX (ConTeXt MkIV macro package)
is capable of typesetting right-to-left math using OpenType fonts.

The font is distributed under OFL 1.1.
