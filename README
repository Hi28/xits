This is an OpenType math font font based on He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
math fonts.

The final release of this font shall support both Latin-based, left to
right and Arabic-based right to left math typesetting.

Though the font is in early development stages, then Latin-based part is
more or less done and once He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named first release is out,
we'll be preparing an initial release of this font. Bug reports are very
appreciated.

The Arabic-based part is still experimental and serves as a test bed for
exploring high quality Arabic mathematical typesetting. Input and idea
are highly appreciated.

The font is based on beta release He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named fonts
distributed by Mozilla, though the license is quite free, it is in free
enough to allow derivative work in a practical way. However, the final
release is planed to be under OFL, based on this this font is distributed
under OFL 1.1, hopping nobody is going to sue me.
