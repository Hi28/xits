This is an experimental OpenType math font font based on
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named math fonts.

The ultimate goal of the font is to develop a math font suitable
for Arabic math typesetting, mainly for LuaTeX engine, and a usable
Times-like math font as a side effect.

The font is distributed under OFL 1.1.
