FONTLOG for XITS
-------------------
This file provides detailed information on the XITS font software.
This information should be distributed along with the XITS fonts
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
--------------------------
XITS is a Times-like typeface for mathematical and scientific publishing,
based on STIX fonts project. The main mission of XITS is to provide a version
of STIX fonts enriched with the OpenType MATH extension, making it suitable
for high quality mathematic typesetting with OpenType MATH capable layout
systems, like MS Office 2007 and the new TeX engines XeTeX and LuaTeX.

XITS development is currently hosted on:
http://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math

Feature requests, bug reports and patches should be directed to our issue
tracker.

ChangeLog
----------
4 Jun 2010 (Khaled Hosny) <XITS Math> Version 1.0
- Edit various font metadata
- Initial release of "XITS Math"
- Add sub/superscript variants of primes
- Fix displaced \widehat and sisters:
     The original STIX glyphs for wide variants of combining marks have zero
     width, this breaks its horizontal positioning, and since Cambria ones have
     positive with we should do the same.
- Fix variants of long combining slash (U+0338):
     They are vertical not horizontal variants.
- Remove unused slots
- More italic correction:
     Covers most lower case letters now.
- Italic correction:
     Add italic correction values to improve horizontal positioning of
     sub/superscripts relative to many base glyphs.
- Fix the vertical positions of \[over|under]brace:
     The original STIX glyphs are swapped vertically (under taking position
     of over and vice versa), but this seems to cause wrong placement with
     ConTeXt.
- Don't mark poth parts of \Vert extensible
- Ask FontForge to guess the BlueValues:
     Taco suggests this would fix the bad hinting issue, since I didn't notice
     any hinting issues, I'm not sure if this makes any difference.
- Fix vertical bar composition:
     LuaTeX complains about the lack of a fixed part.
- Add 'frac' feature for text fractions
- Add oldstyle numbers
- Horizontal construction
- More vertical contruction:
     Covers most common cases now.
- Add vertical variants of fraction slash:
     STIX have no vertical variants of fraction slash, so I used slash variants
     instead, hope it is OK.
- Add radical vertical composition
- Add horizontal top accent position values
- Mark extended shapes
- Italic corection of text integrals
- Map horizontal variants
- Add generated file to the repository
- Add italic correction to display integrals
- Add the rest of vertical variants
- Add vertical variants of integral symbols
- Initialize MATH table
