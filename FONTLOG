FONTLOG for XITS
-------------------
This file provides detailed information on the XITS font software.
This information should be distributed along with the XITS fonts
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
--------------------------
XITS is a Times-like typeface for mathematical and scientific publishing,
based on STIX fonts project. The main mission of XITS is to provide a version
of STIX fonts enriched with the OpenType MATH extension, making it suitable
for high quality mathematic typesetting with OpenType MATH capable layout
systems, like MS Office 2007 and the new TeX engines XeTeX and LuaTeX.

XITS development is currently hosted on:
http://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math

Feature requests, bug reports and patches should be directed to our issue
tracker.
