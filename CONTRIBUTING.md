------------

The preferred way for modifying the fonts is by editing the SFD files under
`sources` directory in the [source repository][3], using [FontForge][1]. When
submitting patches, please run `make normalize` before committing and avoid
any unrelated or unnecessary changes.

To build the fonts from source you need GNU Make, [FontForge][1] Python module,
and [FontTools][2].
