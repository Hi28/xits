This is a set of disorganised test file that I dump here occasionally,
don't get fooled by the name of this directory.

Files with .tex extensions, are usually ConTeXt files, they usually have
3 modes, the default which uses Computer Modern fonts, "xits" which uses
XITS fonts and "cambria" which uses Cambria fonts, this is useful for
comparing the output of the three font families. To run, issue:

$ context foo.tex                # CM mode
$ context --mode=xits foo.tex    # XITS mode
$ context --mode=cambria foo.tex # Cambria mode

Files with .ltx are LaTeX files and can be run with either LaTeX or XeTeX
using LaTeX format, usually to compare the output of both engines:

$ lualatex foo.ltx # LuaTeX engine
$ xelatex foo.ltx  # XeTeX engine
